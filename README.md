Creating a resoucre group is extremely simple using Azure. Once you are logged in to your account, you search for research goups then hit the create tab. After clicking the create tab Azure will as you what you want to name it, what subscription it will be under in your account, as well as what server you would like to make your reseach group in. Finally you would hit the review+create button on the bottom of the screen and deploy your new resource group. As shown in the picture the resource group I had created was the RGNetworkLabJaray.

Now for virtual machines it is somewhat of a similar process as the resource groups. You would look up virtual machines and then hit the create button and then click on make new virtual machine. Next you would choose the subscription you want it to be under along with what resource group you want to make the VM in. (If you did not already make a resource group it does give you sn option to create one as well). Then you would name the VM and choose the server it will be on, (the server should be the same server that is being used for the resource group). Lastly you would go through the rest of the settings and networking settings like size, image, etc, that fit your needs. (The price that the VM will cost a month will vary dependent on the settings you choose). The photos shows the successful creation and deployment of two VM's, one for Linux and one for windows. Each one would cost around $70 if ran for a whole month straight.
